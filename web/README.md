# Smart Games Web

This Front-End project was developed for the game store of the fictitious company Smart Games as part of a training exercise to enhance my React skills. The main objective was to create a modern and responsive user interface that offers a pleasant and intuitive browsing experience.

The application allows users to explore the game library, view details such as name, price, and product image, and make purchases easily. Features such as category search filters and a QR Code system to simplify the purchase process were included to enrich the user experience.

Throughout the development, I focused on applying best coding practices, such as componentization, to ensure clean and scalable code. Additionally, the project was structured to allow for easy integration of new features in the future.
