# Smart Games

The Smart Games project was designed to be a complete platform for a game store, covering both the front-end (user interface), the back-end (API for data management), and a mobile app, all interconnected to provide a seamless and integrated experience.

The goal of Smart Games is to offer users a simple and modern way to browse, search, and purchase games, with features like search filters, store listings, and categorization by platforms. Additionally, the mobile app offers a dedicated interface for users who prefer to access the store directly from their mobile devices.
