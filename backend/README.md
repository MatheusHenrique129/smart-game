# Smart Games API

This is the back-end for the Smart Games project, an API developed for the fictitious Smart Games game store. The purpose of this project is to provide a robust platform for managing games, stores, and platforms via an API interface.

The project was built with scalability, maintainability, and future feature integration in mind. Best coding practices were applied to ensure clean and well-structured code.
